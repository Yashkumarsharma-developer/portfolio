<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Yash Kumar Sharma from Uttar Pradesh, India. Currently, I'm pursuing my education at Thapar institute, where I've started to dive deep into the world of web development and programming.</p>

  During my first year in college, I was introduced to C programming, which laid the foundation for my interest in coding. Although I'm still developing my skills, I have also started learning Python and web development, which I find incredibly fascinating.</p>
  
  Beyond coding, I'm passionate about playing football and watching animes. These activities provide a great balance to my life and help me stay active and creative.</p>
  
  I want to join the society to further develop my skills and to build a network of friends and connections who can support my growth. Being part of a community of like-minded individuals will not only enhance my learning experience but also provide opportunities for personal and professional development.</p>
  
  I'm excited about the potential to contribute to the society and to learn from others. I'm eager to take on new challenges, participate in projects, and make lasting friendships that will help me grow both as a coder and as a person.</p>
